// Divisors come in pairs, like i=12 has divisors 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. Except when i is a square, like 36 has divisors 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, and double divisor 6. So bulb i ends up on if and only if i is a square.

    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
